        <br>A brief message from our co-founder, <b>Otto</b>.<br><br>
        Thank you for your interest, your curiosity and your eagerness. It's
        flattering and rest assured we are working hard to make sure this
        platform is accessible for everyone. Our sole aim is to build a tool
        to help millions of young adults and career chasers in the acquisition
        of their purpose in life by very simple means.<br><br>

        The platform will be free for those who need it and priced for individuals
        who want it. The talented and aspiring individuals that will use our platform
        will because they want less, alleviating busy schedules and giving back time
        best spent on other activities.<br><br>

        I have found it hard not telling you what and who we are but in time
        we will introduce ourselves. Our platform will cause a cataclysmic event in the
        recruitment and job finding world. It will support job boards and agencies
        at the same time as boosting an individuals ability to succeed.<br><br>

        We look forward to revealing Otayer to you all. Until then, feel free to
        follow us on our scarce <a href="https://www.twitter.com/UseOtayer">Twitter</a> account as we'll be posting updates soon.<br><br><br>
